### **Offline-First Design**

#### **Data Persistence**
```typescript
// Automatic lesson caching
const cachedLesson: CachedLesson = {
  id: generatedLesson.id,
  title: generatedLesson.title,
  content: generatedLesson.content,
  activities: generatedLesson.activities,
  keyPoints: generatedLesson.keyPoints,
  cachedAt: new Date(),
};
await offlineService.cacheLessons([cachedLesson]);
```

#### **Smart Cache Management**
- **Configurable Limits**: 50 lessons, 10 chats by default
- **Expiry System**: 30-day automatic cleanup
- **Size Monitoring**: Real-time storage usage tracking
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Finds similar cached content before API calls

#### **Network-Aware Operations**
```typescript
// Graceful degradation
if (!networkStatus.isConnected) {
  const cachedLessons = await offlineService.getCachedLessons();
  const existingLesson = cachedLessons.find(lesson => 
    lesson.title.toLowerCase().includes(request.topic.toLowerCase())
  );
  return existingLesson || generateFallbackLesson(request);
}
```

### **AI Integration Architecture**

#### **Local Model Communication**
```typescript
// Lesson generation with local GPT-OSS
const conversation = {
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: 'You are an expert educational content creator...'
    },
    {
      role: 'developer',
      content: `Create lesson: Topic: ${topic}, Difficulty: ${difficulty}...`
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `Generate a ${difficulty} lesson about "${topic}"`
    }
  ]
};
```
